What is this abomination!? binary tree is such a simple data structure, why is it implemented so lenghty-ly here ? I want your help in following ways:

1. Firstly, what do you think about this implementation? your unbiased comments on this

2. I want to understand the rational behind such a lenghty implementation

3. I then want to understand the core skeleton of binary tree. Which can be implemented in competetive programming, in interviews or in solving technical coding challenges. I wont be able to reproduce this implementation in such a situation.

So, give me such an implementation of binary tree which is typically, and mostly used in competetive programming and on platforms like hackrank, leetcode etc
